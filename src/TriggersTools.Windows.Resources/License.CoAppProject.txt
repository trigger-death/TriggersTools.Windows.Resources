trigger_death's Changes:
* Structures were given their original names
* Added MS documentation to Kernel32, structures, and a few enumerations.
* It's still half-modified, but not too much of it is needed.
* Kernel32.cs is based off what I was originally creating in Win32.cs.
* A few methods were merged from CoApps Kernel32.cs.
